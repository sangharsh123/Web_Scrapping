thanks , dear sir i dont mind, if you dont give me any opportunity to work with you then honestly speaking i learned something from you. 



i follwed method during scrapping
Step 1: Find the URL that you want to scrape
Step 2: Get the source HTML code as text
Step 3: Convert that text into a bs4 lxml object
Step4: Decide/Identify the tags
Step5: Get the value(s) present in each tag into a list/tuple/dictionary
Step6: Create a data frame out of the final list and name the columns as cust_name, review_title, review_description, review_date, and star_rating.
